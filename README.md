# Empty Project Template

This is an empty boilerplate for future HTML/CSS projects. Clone this repo to get started on a new project.

`git clone https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/html-template.git`

Now that we've cloned this repo, we'll need to set a new remote location. After creating a new Github repo, use this command:

`git remote set-url origin [THE-NEW-GITHUB-REPO-URL]`

Now push to the new remote repo, and we're ready to roll.
